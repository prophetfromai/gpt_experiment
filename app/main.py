"""
This is a Python script that serves as the starting point for a web application using FastAPI.
FastAPI is a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

This script does several things:
1. Sets up the web application with some basic information like its name and version.
2. Connects parts of the application that handle different tasks or sections of the website (known as routing).
3. Customizes how the application's API will appear in the auto-generated documentation.
4. Redirects anyone visiting the base URL of the website to the API documentation page.

You can run this script using a command-line tool like Uvicorn, which is a server that lets your application talk to web browsers.
